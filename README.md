This is the code for my experiments on Robot Authority and Human Obedience using the Magic Lab's PR2 robot: gutsy. The PR2 was placed in a publicly accessible building, where it worked as an autonomous security guard. The main aim of the experiment was to do a qualitative and quantative analysis of the factors that affect human obedience in interactions with robots in position of authority.
